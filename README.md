# Calculator
The Java-based Calculator is a console application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Built using Java, it operates through a simple text interface where users input numbers and select the desired operation. The program processes the inputs and outputs the result directly in the console. This project showcases fundamental Java programming concepts like input handling, conditionals, and loops, making it a useful tool for learning and practicing basic programming skills without the need for a graphical user interface.
